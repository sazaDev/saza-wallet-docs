# Account Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
When you login with your private key, you don't need to complete account setup
{% endhint %}

## Enable two-factor authentication

2FA is required for all registered users when login in and submitting transactions to the Stellar network via the Saza wallet.

To enable 2FA you need an app like Authy or Google Authenticator

* Scan the QRcode presented or enter the Activation Key into the app
* You should see a 6-digit code generated every 30 seconds
* Enter this code into the form on Saza and click on enable

Once complete this enables 2FA for your account.

## Add Transaction Passphrase



The transaction passphrase is used \(with other values\) to encrypt your private key should you wish to save it on Saza Wallet. It is important that you memorise this passphrase as it can not be reset. Do not share this passphrase with any one.

When adding your passphrase, Saza will generate a suggestion for you. 

* Select to use the suggested passphrase or enter your own.
* Enter the 2FA auth code from your app
* Click on save.

Once completed you will need to enter this passphrase before you submit a transaction

That's it you are ready to start using your Saza wallet.
