# Federation

Stellar federated addresses allow users to match a user-friendly name to their public key. This can then be shared instead of the public key when receiving payments.

On Saza wallet, you can pick a federated address per account. The address will be in this format

> _**username\*saza.io**_

Username can be your email address or some other unique string.

{% hint style="info" %}
Saza wallet charges a 1 XLM per federated address to deter spamming
{% endhint %}
